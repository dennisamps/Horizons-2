  <p><b>Repository:</b> Github was used to store the changes made to the website online. This mean that as the website was being developed the user had to push the currrent version to the Github repository saving that current version online. This allowed the use to do version control and roll back versions should a mistake happen that caused there to be an error on the site. It also allows different people to collaborate on the same project.</p>
  <p><b>IDE</b>: integrated development environment used to code the website was 'ATOM'. ATOM becuase although it is not the only IDE that allowed the user to connect to Github it is easy to use and has a shollow learning curve. The feature which allows the user to open the project folder in the IDE is particulary useful as the user can easily find the desired file without having to leave the IDE.</p>
  <p><b>Website Languages:</b> HTML was used to define the structure of the website. CSS was used to give each element in the HTML a style/deign. JavaScript was used to enhance the user experience by allowing things to be animated for instance the scroll easing when clicking a section on the website in the navigaion bar.</p>
  <p><b>Browser:</b> as the website was being developed the Google Chrome browser was used to see how the website looked. The inspect feature on Chrome was also used to identify elements and their class or id tags in the HTML and CSS so that they could be editted</p>

    <p>A domain name is the address of a website and is the name at which users can find your
page on the internet. To create a custom domain first you must register the name you’d like
with a domain name system, to make sure it is not already taken. Ordinarily you’d have to
pay this company to host your unique domain and connect it to an IP address. Once you
have got your custom domain you can add it to you page in Github – another benefit of using
this tool.</p>

    <p> <b> 1. Easy to navigate </b><br>
    A user interface with a navigation flow which mimics that which a user would
    naturally/comfortably make is the best type of page, as it improves the overall
    user experience

    <br><b> 2. Quick loading time </b><br>
    Fast loading times improve the ease of navigation and user involvement with the
    website

    <br><b>3. Interactive</b><br>
    The user interface is responsive and uses web tools to make components of the
    page responsive to specific user interactions, in order to make it more intuitive


    <br><b> 4.Intuitive </b><br>
    A site should be easy to navigate through without additional description. Every
    feature and component should be designed to make sense to every user.

    <b><br> 5. Simple </b><br>
    A simple page that is void of clutter is easier to navigate and will result in
    an elevated user experience on the site. ‘100 simple pages > 1 cluttered one’.

  <div class="card-body">
    <p> Web accessibility uses varying inclusive practices to ensure a web page is
    free from barriers that could prevent people with certain disabilities or
    restrictions from interacting with the site.

    <br><h4>Some of these include:</h4>

    <b> Visual: </b> partial vision or the inability to perceive colour or contrast

    <br><b> Hearing:</b> Reduced hearing ability

    <br><b> Motor/physical:</b> Mobility issues, difficulty moving certain body parts or fine
    motor movement

    <br><b>Photosensitive seizures:</b> conditions such as epilepsy can be triggered by flashing
     lights and cause seizures

    <br><b>Cognitive:</b> conditions such as dementia and dyslexia may affect cognitive ability

    <br><b>Socio-economic:</b> certain socioeconomic factors can cause restrictions on bandwidth
     and speed of internet when browsing
     </p>


    <h3> Considerations:</h3>

    <b>Colour:</b> Due to visual impairments, colour cannot be solely used to covey
    information, but other design considerations should be used to ensure the visually
     impaired have the same intuitive experience. Additionallt, colours which have a
     distinct contrast should be used when overlaying colours.

    <br><b>Structure:</b> Arranging the contents of the webpage will improve the flow
    for Users
    when using the site- especially those with cognitive difficulties.

    <br><b>Alt text:</b> the use of alt text for images allows a description of
    photographs to be read out to users who wouldn’t otherwise have access to the image

    <h1>GDPR</h1>
   <h3> Definition:</h3>
   GDPR stands for <u>'General Data Protection Regulation' </u>
    and is a legal data protection and privacy framework upheld by the European
    Union which defines how personal information of EU residents is processed, and
    can be seen as an expansion of the Data Protection Act 1998.
    EU residents have autonomy over their data and can request a copy of any of their stored
    personal data. They can also request to be “forgotten” by entities that hold their data.

   <br> <b>EU Residents have the following rights under GDPR, therefore the following
      must be upheld:</b> <br>

   <b>1. Right to be informed</b> <br>
   Be transparent about the intended use of personal data. Typically
   handled through the site’s privacy policy.
   <br><b>2. Right of access</b> <br>
   Data must be provided on request, and should be provided in commonly used format such as CSV.
   <br><b>3. Right to rectification</b> <br>
   Allow a client to correct incomplete or inaccurate information.
   <br><b>4. Right to erasure</b> <br>
   Clients can request deletion or removal of personal data when there is no compelling
   reason for its continued processing. Also referred to as “the right to be forgotten.”
   <br><b>5. Right to restrict processing</b> <br>
   Data can be stored but no longer processed if clients block the processing of
   their personal data.
   <br><b>6. Right to portability</b> <br>
   Allow individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes.
   <br><b>7. Right to object</b> <br>
   Individuals can object to having their personal information used.
   This includes for purposes of direct marketing, research and statistics.
   <br><b>8. Rights related to automatic decision making, including profiling</b> <br>
   This rule specifies when you can use profiling and automated decision making.
   It also defines requirements that must be met, such as the individual providing explicit consent.
