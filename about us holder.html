    <h1> About Us</h1>

    <p>
      The manual development of photographs is a traditional practice that has been upheld due to its versatile possibilities. Fanatics have preserved this craft despite the advances in printing technology to maintain the integrity and the true authenticity of the craft. Although, this ancient craft is desired to be maintained we at BlackBox (change the name depending on your website) felt there was no reason why the traditional way of developing photos couldnâ€™t be automated whilst upholding the purity of the process.

    <p>
      We studied the process taken by photo developers, and took into account their needs: 
    </p>

    <h2>Working in darkness</h2>

    <p>
      We noticed that low light levels (red if you are developing black and white or complete darkness if you are developing colour) are required to get the optimal photograph. This makes the process time consuming as the technician has to feel their way around the dark room to find the right containers whilst being careful not to back contaminate the developing liquids.
    </p>

    <h2>Fumes</h2>

    <p>
      We also found that the fumes emitted by the developing liquids could cause light-headedness when excessively inhaled.

    <h2>Time Keeping</h2>

    <p>
      It was this that inspired us to create BlackBox an automatic photograph developer. To provide simpler, safer, quicker way to develop. Photo developing done the traditional way. Click here to find out more
